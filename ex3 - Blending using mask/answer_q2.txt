Using a bigger filter size for creating the image pyramids makes each level of the pyramids contain lower frequencies.
Thus blending the 2 pyramids gives more weight to the lower frequencies in the blend.
Since the first level of the pyramid always contains the highest frequencies, the image will still be blended in the
highest frequencies but most of the middle frequencies will not be blended.
This means the emphasis in the blend will be less on the fine details and more in the general color blocks.
