The ability to multiply each of the Laplacian pyramid's levels allows us to create a band pass filter.
For example, by choosing the 0 coefficient for L0 we will not allow the highest frequencies in the resulting image and
by choosing the 0 coefficient for Ln we will not allow the lowest frequencies (and of course we can combine these and
any other levels).
